    Now, this assumes that the authentication will be provided to the user.
    We can also enable the ANONYMOUS mode, and set the default org as the demo one
    This WON'T scale, since we'll need to support multiple users anyway.

    The only viable solution is an authentication proxy.
    But still, even the proxy authentication seems to work by converting
    the basic auth into a header, and we're using a custom auth for the
    flask application... ðŸ˜ª

    The best quick & dirty way for a one-user scenario would be to enable
    anonymous mode and hardcode the org id.
